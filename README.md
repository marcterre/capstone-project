# Capstone Project

This is my capstone-project for the web-development bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en).

## PocketBuilder

My app is especially designed for all hobbyists and craftsmen who want to plan new projects and retrieve them at any time. 
It is possible to create projects and adding a image for each one. You can create different views for your project, like a cut or detail view. Also you can add materials as many as you need and edit or delete your entries as you like.
Special feature are the image upload, for that i implemented cloudinary, and the swipe-to-delete function for the material list. [Take a closer look](#have-a-closer-look).
